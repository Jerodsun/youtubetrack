0,CRUZ AT EL PASO MAGA RALLY: Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) Speaks Ahead of President Trump (FNN),"President Donald Trump is trying to turn the debate over a wall at the U.S.-Mexico border back to his political advantage as his signature pledge to American voters threatens to become a model of unfulfilled promises.

Trump will hold his first campaign rally since November's midterm elections in El Paso, Texas, on Monday as he faces a defining week for his push on the wall -- and for his presidency and his 2020 prospects. Weakened by the disastrous government shutdown and facing a fresh deadline Friday, Trump is trying to convince people that that he'll continue to push to build his long-promised wall, even though there's no way it would be anywhere near complete by the time voters have to decide whether to give him another term.

A bipartisan group of lawmakers were negotiating ahead of Friday's deadline, but on Sunday people familiar with the talks said the mood among the bargainers had grown sour. They spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss private talks. #MAGA #Trump #TrumpElPaso",-0.16455

4,Ted Cruz Thinks He's Going To Beat Beto O'Rourke (HBO),"Columbus, Texas — Senator Ted Cruz is not assuming anything in his campaign for re-election. He’s a popular politician in a state that hasn’t sent a Democrat to the senate in 25 years. But polls show him in a surprisingly tight race with the young, telegenic upstart Beto O’Rourke, who’s captivated liberal crowds in Texas, and celebrity endorsements across the nation.

That’s why Cruz was here on Saturday, at an intimate gathering in a deep red town halfway between Houston and San Antonio: to rally the faithful back to his cause.

“The danger is that the economy is booming, people are focused on their jobs and their kids, going to church, going to the ballgame, and they just don't make it out to vote,” Cruz told the crowd. “Our danger is complacency.”

Cruz leads O’Rourke by 4 percentage points, according to the Real Clear Politics average. But he faces more than just the familiar incumbents’ paradox that when things are good, parties in power have a hard time mobilizing voters.

The bigger worry is voter overconfidence. According to internal Republican National Committee data reported by Axios, the Republican faithful are unusually immune to reports showing that Democratic candidates are on the rise. One recent RNC survey found that 57% of strong Trump supporters don’t believe that Democrats will retake the House.

“To me, the polls that we're seeing right now are eerily similar to the Trump-Clinton polls that we saw going up to the election,” said Tom Kelley, the GOP chair for Colorado County, at Cruz’s stop in Columbus. “It's all hype and hyperbole.”

That’s why Cruz can’t simply ignore the huge crowds being drawn out by his opponent.

“We're going to win this race,” Cruz told VICE News. “I feel very good about where we are. But the reason we're going to win it is we're not taking anything for granted. It is clear there are a lot of folks on the far left who are really angry and that anger — it's a motivator. It is bringing dollars, it's bringing passion, it's bringing energy. And we have to take it seriously.”

5,VYING FOR RE-ELECTION: Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) at #MAGArally in Houston (FNN),"At least 77,000 people have signed up for President Trump’s Houston rally on Monday to support incumbent Republican Sen. Ted Cruz, who is locked in the Texas Senate battle with Democratic Congressman Beto O’Rourke. 

The Houston Chronicle reported that Houston police will be “fully mobilized” for the rally. Attendees must have tickets to enter and will be admitted in the order that they line up, the report said.

""Keep in mind that once the capacity is met, you won't get in whether you have a ticket or not,"" an officer said.

More than 77,800 people had signed up for the rally by Friday morning, according to The Chronicle. A person familiar with the event told the paper that the Trump campaign was not considering a move to a larger venue.

Houston police heard unconfirmed reports that a separate nearby rally for O’Rourke could also draw thousands, according to the report.

""We will have many many officers out and about,"" Chied Art Acevedo said. ""We will have officers on the high ground, low ground, in the air. We will have officers in plainclothes, we will have undercover officers, we will have react teams.""

33,Watch 16 Beto O’Rourke And Ted Cruz Supporters Debate Each Other (HBO),"The Senate race between Ted Cruz and his challenger, Texas congressman Beto O’Rourke, has become a symbol of the battle over a state that Democrats have long wanted to turn blue. So when 16 Texas voters — half supporters of each candidate — came to face-to-face, it’s no surprise a national issue like immigration dominated the discussion.

During a VICE News panel convened by pollster Frank Luntz Friday in Dallas, participants talked about their impressions of the candidates and the issues animating the campaign. So far, O’Rourke has drawn a record fundraising haul and lots of media attention, but polling still shows GOP Sen. Cruz slightly ahead.

Cruz has attacked O’Rourke for proposing making so-called Dreamers American citizens, which Cruz says would put the interests of immigrants ahead of ordinary Texans. Cruz has said his own views on immigration boil down to four words: “legal, good — illegal, bad.” During their Sept. 21 debate, Cruz said the U.S. should do everything possible to secure the border, including building a wall.

On Friday, panelists supporting Cruz agreed. “There are sovereign countries that have laws. Obey those laws,” said John Percha III, a 49 year-old aircraft mechanic. “You can’t just walk in and do whatever you want.”

“America is like a lifeboat,” added Paul Lidberg, 52, a sales account manager and game designer. “And at a certain point if you bring everybody into the lifeboat, the lifeboat sinks.”

But O’Rourke supporters said that anger over the state of the immigration system is misdirected — and that immigrants themselves should not be blamed.

“I guarantee you, as a mother of two boys, that I would do everything illegal, legal — it doesn't matter what it is — to get my children into this country,” said Angie Byrnes, 47, the owner of a marketing consulting business.

Angelique Mayers, a 46 year-old customer service agent, proposed penalties for people who hire undocumented workers. “Why do we demonize the people that get lured here by business owners that have jobs waiting for them?” Mayers asked. “Why don't we do mandatory prison time for anybody that hires an illegal alien?”

Eight of the sixteen panelists had at least one parent born outside of the U.S. But that didn’t mean all panelists wanted to loosen immigration laws.

“Should there be a path to citizenship? I'm Hispanic, and I don't think so,” said Josue Gonzalez, a 32 year-old security contractor and Cruz supporter. “Maybe consider giving them status to stay here legally but not impact the voting, the platform for either Democrat or Republican.”

Julio Rios, 47, an unemployed Cruz supporter and the son of Uruguayan and Cuban immigrants, said that the country’s roughly 12 million undocumented immigrants should be put on a ten year work visa, with an annual fee of $1,000 to maintain the visa. The money, Rios said, should be used to fund a border wall. He called the plan a “modified path to citizenship.”

Asked to describe the candidates, supporters of Cruz called him principled and steadfast. Critics called Cruz smarmy — a word that Cruz’s supporters later used to describe O’Rourke, too, along with “socialist.” O’Rourke’s supporters called him compassionate.

Last week’s confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court also came up. Sophia Percha, a 48-year-old realtor and Cruz supporter, said the Democratic Party had hijacked the #MeToo movement and pursued Kavanaugh without proof.

Challenged by another panelist, Sophia Percha said she herself had survived abuse. “However, I would not blame this person sitting next to me that he did it because he looks like the type that did it,” Sophia Percha said.

One panelist said that the Kavanaugh hearings had ensured she’d vote Republican.

“Before the Kavanaugh thing, I probably wasn't going to vote. But this Kavanaugh thing is going to turn out a lot of people, because I think they did him totally wrong,” said Jennifer McCann, a 47-year-old customs broker who supports Cruz but often votes Democrat.

“If they did him wrong, they’re gonna make all of us wrong,” Percha added.

O'Rourke and Cruz will face off again Tuesday night in a televised debate.

40,"FULL MAGA RALLY: Pres. Trump Campaigns for Ted Cruz in Houston, Texas (FNN)","At least 77,000 people have signed up for President Trump’s Houston rally on Monday to support incumbent Republican Sen. Ted Cruz, who is locked in the Texas Senate battle with Democratic Congressman Beto O’Rourke. 

The Houston Chronicle reported that Houston police will be “fully mobilized” for the rally. Attendees must have tickets to enter and will be admitted in the order that they line up, the report said.

""Keep in mind that once the capacity is met, you won't get in whether you have a ticket or not,"" an officer said.

More than 77,800 people had signed up for the rally by Friday morning, according to The Chronicle. A person familiar with the event told the paper that the Trump campaign was not considering a move to a larger venue.

Houston police heard unconfirmed reports that a separate nearby rally for O’Rourke could also draw thousands, according to the report.

""We will have many many officers out and about,"" Chied Art Acevedo said. ""We will have officers on the high ground, low ground, in the air. We will have officers in plainclothes, we will have undercover officers, we will have react teams.""
