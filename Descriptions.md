In a controlled experiment, decisions will be based solely on objective factors. However, descriptions and videos don't often match up well - Youtube is a video site, after all, not a text site. However, most descriptions accurately reflect the sentiment of the video.

Question: For three each type of voter: Those who support the candidate, those with no opinion, those who don't support the candidate, what effect does the video have on them?

Below are attempts to establish a uniform scoring guideline.

ANALYSIS:
This video is a parody of Ted Cruz. Through lip-reading, the narrators create an alternate characterization of his speech. While political satire, this by itself portrays Cruz in a negative light.

SCORE:
Support factor is -3.


TITLE:
